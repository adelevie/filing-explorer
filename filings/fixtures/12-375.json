We do incur real cost to administer inmate calling service, however, the rates set by the FCC eliminate commissions to jails and on inter-state calls and does not include any allowance for cost recovery for jails. This would impact our current budget since the budget has already set for 2014. Your consideration in this matter will be appreciated.

The same call in Great Falls to Great Falls.. Approximately $ 4.50 for the entire 15 minutes, which is still a complete ripoff.  If this is not pure greed and dishonesty then I don?t know what is.  The CEO and President needs to speed some time behind bars and see how it feels.  I would love for securus to break down exactly what their expense on this call was and what was their income.  I would bet it was about $ 1.00 in expenses.. and 8 dollars for the Cascade County Sherriff?s office and 12 dollars in profit for securus.

The MPSC strongly agrees with the comments filed by National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), indicating that, states are in the best position to oversee and investigate matters re lating to ICS INTRAstate rates and service quality,l and FCC action to expand its authority to affect INTRAstate rates can interfere with existing state programs and undermine State jurisdiction to handle related complaints and revise programs.2 The MPSC also agrees with Centurylink's comments, The Commission should respect the limits of its authority, decline to adopt additional intrastate ICS regulations, and instead leave regulation of intrastate ICS rates and related policy judgments to correctional institutions and the states.3 ' Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, WC Docket No. 12-375, Comments of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, p.3, filed December 20, 2013. 21d. at 4. 3 Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, WC Docket No. 12-375, Comments of Centurylink, p.2, filed December 20, 2013. The MPSC agrees with comments submitted by several parties, including NARUC and Centurylink, explaining that Section 27 6 gives the FCC limited authority regarding compensation to payphone owners, but does not give the FCC rate regulation over intrastate ICS. Additionally, as indicated in comments submitted by Securus Technologies, Inc., Section 152 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.

      "text_data": "JOHN McMAHON, SHERIFF-CORONER November 6, 2014 John McMahon, Sheriff-Coroner 655 East Third Street S(!.Il Bernardino, CA 92415 Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary Federal Communications Commission 445 12th Street, SW Washington, DC 20554 Re: WC Docket No. 12-375 Dear Secretary Dortch, Received & Inspected Nn\\/ ? ~ Z014 FCC Mail Room DOCKET FILE COPY OR\\GlNAL . The San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department (SBCSD) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the FCC's proposed Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling (WC 12-375). San Bernardino County is geographically the largest county in the United States, covering over 20,000 square miles of land. SBCSD comprises the second largest corrections system in California, with an average daily population (ADP) of 6,200 incarcerated individuals. The Department provides our incarcerated population with the opportunity for educational, vocational, cognitive, alcohol and substance abuse, workforce development, community re-entry, and life-skills programs through SBCSD's Inmate Services Unit (ISU). ISU also provides for enhanced medical, nursing, and medical social work services beyond the state's requirements. Funding for benefit programs is solely through the Inmate Welfare Fund (IWF)-inmate programs are all funded by inmate generated revenues, and not by taxpayer dollars. Services and programs are provided through collaborative efforts with the California State University at San Bernardino, San Bernardino Superintendent of Schools, Chaffey Adult School, San Bernardino County Department of Workforce Development, along with professional staff at ISU. California Penal Code Section 4025 statutorily mandates revenues generated from ininate telephone and commissary commissions be deposited into the IWF. Revenues are to be used for the direct benefit of inmates such as recreation, enhanced medical services, and programs. FCC's (WC 12-375) proposal would dramatically reduce the Department IWF revenues by 52%. The impact would shock existing programs, services, goods and availabili.ty for our Department's incarcerated population, therefore rendering programs to become less effective and available. No. of Copies rec'd __ ...,O'---?list ABCDE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT 655 East Third Street ? San Bernardino, California 92415-0061 Post Office Box 569 ? San Bernardino, California 92402-0569 } ... . . . Secretary Marlene H. Dortch WC Docket No. 12-375 Direct Budgetary Impacts to SBCSD The primary responsibility of corrections is to ensure facility, staff safety, inmate welfare and security. Monitoring of inmate calls by corrections staff and Department investigators have prevented a large number of assaults on staff and inmates, along with safeguarding witnesses, and uncovering escape plans. Call monitoring is both labor and time intensive-but it is a vital responsibility in operating inmate call systems (ICS). SBCSD's expenditures directed toward Safety and Security are approximately $456,000 per year. In addition, ICS Providers either possess or contract out investigative tools and analytics to assists corrections staff and Department investigators with the task of ensuring Safety and Security. The FCC's proposal identifies necessary investigative tools as commissions-in-kind, therefore eliminating ICS Providers from including them in competitive packages, and placing the additional expense on SBCSD. SBCSD estimates costs to the Department would be $271,700 annually to include the necessary features. Total annual expenditures for the Department to ensure facility, staff safety, inmate welfare and security will be $727, 700. All of SBCSD's recreation, education, enhanced medical services, and community re-entry programs, along with goods and services are paid through the IWF. To operate on a status-quo basis, IWF expendjtures are currently at $5,671,213. Implementation ofFCC's proposal would result in a 52% reduction in IWF's revenues, equating to $2,450,000 annually. Due to statutory mandates, along with higher and varied classifications of inmates in the Department' s correctional system, the level of services will likely increase to provide inmate and community integration programs for all incarcerated individuals within county jails. Included in commissions-in-kind are the State's statutorily required free calls. Toll free calls for recently booked arrestees are mandated by California Penal Code Section 851.5. The Department also extends free calls to inmates' attorneys and consulates. Traditionally, free calls were part of ICS competitive packages. The FCC proposal, however, would eliminate this option. Expenditures for free calls would be transferred to SBCSD's budget at the estimated amount of$345,600 annually. In total, direct impacts to SBCSD's correctional budget would significantly increase expenditures in the amount of $3,523,300 yearly just to operate at status-quo levels, disregarding additional unfunded statutory mandates, program/service technology upgrades, and increased service requests from the incarcerated population. Operations and Equipment Anticipated Annual Expenditures Safety and Security $456,000 Investigative and Analytic Tools $271 ,700 Cost for Free Calls $345,600 Loss of JCS Commissions $2,450,000 Annual Expenditures to SBCSD $3,523,300 J' . ?. Secretary Marlene H. Dortch WC Docket No. 12-375 The Commission has requested comments regarding the implementation timelines for Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling (WC 12-375). In California, commissions from ICS Providers generally constitute 50% or greater ofIWFs' total revenues to provide direct inmate benefit programs, as well as goods and services. In 2007, Senate Bill 81 (SB-81) was implemented by the California State Legislature. In response, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) decided to eliminate all monetary commissions from ICS Providers. CDCR was given a four-year implementation schedule and transition period to properly adjust for organizational budgets, 1 program assessment, and to make adjustments regarding management and staffing impacts. California possess a larger resource capacity than SBCSD, or the County of San Bernardino to recover from a 52% revenue reduction. SBCSD highly recommends the FCC provide the 58 California Sheriffs Departments a similar time period as was afforded to SB-81 to implement and transition Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling (WC 12-375). Overall, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department opposes the approval of WC 12-375 based upon the negative impacts anticipated with the delivery of inmate progr ing and th creased burden on an already strained county budget.

While I fully support and share the FCC?s desire to move quickly, more time is needed to allow both the public and industry participants sufficient time to meaningfully respond to the Commission?s request for comment.   I have spoken with Lee Petro, counsel for petitioners, Paul Wright of Human Rights Defense Center, Bill Pope of NCIC, Marcus Trathen, counsel for PayTel, Tom Dethlefs of CenturyLink, and Darrell Baker of the Alabama Public Service Commission, all of whom consent to this request.  I therefore request that comments be due on January 20, 2015 and reply comments due February 4, 2015.  I thank you for your work and for considering this request.

I hope more progess will be made in this area regarding rates and fees.  I am commenting today about the necessity of lowering prison/jail intrastate rates and fees.  As you know, most of the calls are intrastate, and are made to family support networks.  I am certain that these exorbitant rates and assoicated fees, can be lowered, thereby facilitating all important family connections and communication.  I certainly recognize that this will require planning and work, but it is imperative to proceed without delay.          Sincerely,         Diana Page ",

People in prison and people with family members in prison need to stay as closely connected as possible.  It is critically important our nation encourage these connections.  The proposal will help people in prison and their families be able to afford more frequent communications.  I have worked with hundreds of families and people in prison.  The high costs of phone communications are a constant challenge.  This proposal would certainly take these costs down and help everyone.  Thank you for your consideration.  William P. Quigley   ",

Ahern, CSSA President Federal Communications Commission Re: FCC Order- WC Docket No. 12-375 re Interstate Inmate Calling Services Office of the Secretary The California State Sheriffs' Association (CSSA) urgently requests that the FCC Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services (WC Docket No. 12-375), scheduled to go into effect February 11,2014, be stayed as it applies to Sheriffs and jails; The FCC Order mandates a one-size-fits-all approach to regulating inmate calling services for both prisons and jails. The Order fails to take into account the unique challenges inherent in providing calling services to the majority of the nation's jails that are small in size and have high turnover of inmate populations weekly. Inmate calling systems are built to the unique needs of each jail and provide a variety of important safety and security components. The Order disregards this reality and creates a regulatory environment that jeopardizes these services. Many jails may be forced to severely limit or eliminate inmate calling privileges. The FCC has recognized in its Order that jails incur real costs to administer inmate calling services; however, the rates set by the FCC eliminate commissions to jails on inter-state calls and do not include any allowance for cost recovery for jails. A STAY must be granted for jails until such time as the FCC and Sheriffs can determine a proper method for jails to recover these costs. Because Sheriffs Office budgets are already set for 2014, many Sheriffs will not have the financial resources necessary to continue to administer inmate calling services and perform the vital security functions required to protect the public.

The FCC did cap long distance phone rates after 11 years of families trying. We are grateful for that change. However this order did not apply to in state calls which now in some cases, in some states are now more costly than the Jong distant rate?. !n-state calls mal:e up fot 85% of all ca!ls from prisons and jails. It is important for incarcerated persons to maintain contact with friends and family, as that helps the inmates' reintroduction into the community. Many studies show communication is critical for this to happen. Presently I am paying $1.00 connection fee for a one-half hour call and .13 a minute. The Nevada Department of Corrections keeps raising the call rates and I am not notified in advance of the rate change. I am on a fixed income and it is difficult for me to call my loved one often and still be able to pay my rent, buy my groceries and medications. May I also suggest that the large commissions paid to the department of corrections be reduced. Please make my comment part of the WC Docket Number 12-375.

During the course of the meeting there was a discussion of the FCC?s open docket on Inmate Calling Services.  Chair Nelson generally reiterated NARUC?s on-the-record positions1 [footnote 1] filed in the FCC?s docketed proceedings that:  [1] Commend the FCC for acting expeditiously to address interstate inmate calling issues,    [2] Express our appreciation for [a] the original NPRM?s acknowledgement that intrastate ISC rates are ?set by the States,?  [3] Generally oppose arguments that would expand the FCC?s jurisdiction to intrastate toll rates or unnecessarily supplant existing State Public Service Commission decisions  over this service. Specifically, while we agree with NASUCA and others that the FCC?s authority with respect to  interstate interexchange calling is clear, the scope of the FCC?s authority to address intrastate, long-distance calls  and/or operator services is not.                                                          1  See.

Many sheriffs will not have the financial resources necessary to continue to administer inmate calling services and perform the vita l security functions required to protect the public. A STAY must be granted for jails until such time as the FCC and Sheriffs can determine a proper method for jails to recover these costs. I appreciate your consideration in this matter.

Dortch, Secretary Federal Communications Commission 445 12th Street SW Washington, DC 20554  Re: Reply Comment on WC 12-375  Dear Ms. Dortch:  In the Federal Communications Commission?s August 9 2013 Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,1 the commissioners ask for confirmation that ICS providers receive a portion of the payment fee charged by third-party payment services such as Western Union.2 The issue of hidden profit in various ?fees? charged by the industry and allied businesses was a major finding of our May 2013 report ?Please Deposit All of Your Money: Kickbacks, Rates, and Hidden Fees in the Jail Phone Industry.?3  Noting that Global Tel*Link4 continues to deny receiving kickbacks from Western Union and other payment processors, we wish to draw your attention to three pieces of evidence that such payments are being made that were not available at the time of our original report:                                                 1 In re Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, WC Docket No. 12-375 (Adopted August 9, 2013), available at http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7520945713.  2 Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, In re Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, WC Docket No. 12-375 at ? 168 (Adopted August 9, 2013). (?In the Order, we require charges for any services that are ancillary to the costs of providing ICS to be cost-based, and require ICS providers to submit cost data for these ancillary service charges as part of the mandatory data request. Here we seek comment on how the Commission can ensure, going forward, that ancillary charges are just, reasonable, and cost-based. For example, the record reflects that ICS providers typically use third parties to process debit and prepaid transactions, and there are concerns that the charges passed on to inmates or their called parties are not entirely cost-based. Is this accurate??) 3 Drew Kukorowski, Peter Wagner, and Leah Sakala, Please Deposit All of Your Money: Kickbacks, Rates, and Hidden Fees in the Jail Phone Industry (May 8, 2013), available at http://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/pleasedeposit.html 4 ??ICS providers cannot control the fees established by third-parties for payment processing functions, such as Western Union or MoneyGram fees or the payment processing fees charged by credit card companies.? (Global Tel*Link Corporation, Comment, In re Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, WC Docket No. 12-375 (received December 20, 2013), available at http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7520964265.)   2 1. The Alabama Public Service Commission reviewed the evidence in that state and concluded that:   ?Money Transfer services (Western Union and MoneyGram) ? Staff recognizes that these fees are set by these financial services but is also aware that agents hosting such services are paid a portion of the fee. Additionally merchants may negotiate the fee charged their customers.?5  2. NCIC has clearly demonstrated that it is possible for providers to control the fees charged by Western Union. After the publication of our report, NCIC reached out to us to assert that the company was not receiving a revenue share from Western Union. When we asked for an explanation for why Western Union was charging NCIC Customers a rate higher than that charged to customers of other companies, NCIC renegotiated its contract with Western Union and had the rate lowered to $5.6   3. Customer Service of America (CSA), affiliated with AmTel, admits that it receives income from Western Union fees and then defends that income as necessary. CSA submitted a comment to the FCC on December 20, 1013 that appears to be responding not to the FCC but to the Alabama Public Service Commission, and makes this surprising admission:   ?CSA respectfully does not agree with a prohibition of the Call Center receiving a portion of a payment from Western?. CSA representatives frequently have to make refunds for Western Union Quick Collect payments and this portion of a processing fee helps to recover the associated refund expense.?7    Notably, the Western Union fee for AmTel is $9.95, meaning that the $10.95 and $11.95 fees charged by Western Union to Global Tel*Link and Securus customers represent an even higher profit to those companies.                                                   5 Alabama Public Service Commission, Errata and Substitute Order Proposing Revised Inmate Phone Service Rules and Establishing a Comment Period, Re: General Proceeding Considering the Promulgation of Telephone Rules Governing Inmate Phone Services, Docket 15957 (October 7, 2013), available at  http://www.psc.state.al.us/Telecom/Engineering/documents/Sub_Ala_ICS_Reform_Order.pdf 6 Prison Policy Initiative, Our Report Leads Two Phone Companies to Clarify & Improve Policies (May 28, 2013), available at http://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2013/05/28/policies/. 7(Emphasis added.) ATN, Inc. / AmTel Comments on Changes to Rules for Inmate Calling Services Docket #: 12-375,  In re Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, WC Docket No. 12-375 (received December 20, 2013), available at http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7520964042.   3The exact extent to which a portion of the third-party fee is actually cost-based may still be up for debate, but the FCC can be confident that a portion of the fees charged by third parties such as Western Union for payments to certain providers is in fact being collected by ICS companies.  We recommend that the FCC adopt Alabama?s approach to regulating fees and kickbacks from third party payment servicers:   ?All ICS providers shall submit, for informational purposes to the Commission, the transaction fee charged their customers by Western Union and MoneyGram for ICS payments and will update this information as the fees change. Staff will compare fees submitted by all ICS providers and require justification from ICS providers for any observed anomalies.?8  Sincerely,   Peter Wagner Executive Director    Aleks Kajstura Legal Director                                                   8 Alabama Public Service Commission, Errata and Substitute Order Proposing Revised Inmate Phone Service Rules and Establishing a Comment Period, Re: General Proceeding Considering the Promulgation of Telephone Rules Governing Inmate Phone Services, Docket 15957 (October 7, 2013) at 17, available at  http://www.psc.state.al.us/Telecom/Engineering/documents/Sub_Ala_ICS_Reform_Order.pdf ",
